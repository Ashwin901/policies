description: The rule of 3-2-1 recommends that you have at least 3 copies of data, on 2 different storage targets, and 1 being offsite.  3-2-1 ensures a health mix of redundancy options for data recovery of the application for localized & multi-region cloud failures or compromise. In K8s/K10, this translates to the original StatefulSet (the original PersistentVolumeClaim), a backup (a snapshot of the PVC on prod storage), and an export to cloud object storage (a secondary cloud copy of the PVC snapshot).
