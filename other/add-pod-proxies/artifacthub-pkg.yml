description: In restricted environments, Pods may not be allowed to egress directly to all destinations and some overrides to specific addresses may need to go through a corporate proxy. This policy adds proxy information to Pods in the form of environment variables. It will add the `env` array if not present. If any Pods have any of these env vars, they will be overwritten with the value(s) in this policy.
