description: Pods which don't specify at least resource requests are assigned a QoS class of BestEffort which can hog resources for other Pods on Nodes. At a minimum, all Pods should specify resource requests in order to be labeled as the QoS class Burstable. This sample mutates any container in a Pod which doesn't specify memory or cpu requests to apply some sane defaults.
