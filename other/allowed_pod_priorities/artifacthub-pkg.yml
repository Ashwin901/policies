description: A Pod PriorityClass is used to provide a guarantee on the scheduling of a Pod relative to others. In certain cases where not all users in a cluster are trusted, a malicious user could create Pods at the highest possible priorities, causing other Pods to be evicted/not get scheduled. This policy checks the defined `priorityClassName` in a Pod spec to a dictionary of allowable PriorityClasses for the given Namespace stored in a ConfigMap. If the `priorityClassName` is not among them, the Pod is blocked.
