description: By default, images that have already been pulled can be accessed by other Pods without re-pulling them if the name and tag are known. In multi-tenant scenarios, this may be undesirable. This policy mutates all incoming Pods to set their imagePullPolicy to Always. An alternative to the Kubernetes admission controller AlwaysPullImages.
