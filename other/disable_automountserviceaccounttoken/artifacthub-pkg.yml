description: A new ServiceAccount called `default` is created whenever a new Namespace is created. Pods spawned in that Namespace, unless otherwise set, will be assigned this ServiceAccount. This policy mutates any new `default` ServiceAccounts to disable auto-mounting of the token into Pods obviating the need to do so individually.
