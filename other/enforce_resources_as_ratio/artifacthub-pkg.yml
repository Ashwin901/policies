description: Resource requests often need to be tailored to the type of workload in the container/Pod. With many different types of applications in a cluster, enforcing hard limits on requests or limits may not work and a ratio may be better suited instead. This policy checks every container in a Pod and ensures that memory limits are no more than 2.5x its requests.
