description: Container images which use metadata such as the LABEL directive in a Dockerfile do not surface this information to apps running within. In some cases, running the image as a container may need access to this information. This policy injects the value of a label set in a Dockerfile named `maintainer` as an environment variable to the corresponding container in the Pod.
