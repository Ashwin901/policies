    # Label Nodes with CRI Runtime
    	CRI engines log in different formats. Loggers deployed as DaemonSets don't know which format to apply because they can't see this information. By Kyverno writing a label to each node with its runtime, loggers can use node label selectors to know which parsing logic to use. This policy detects the CRI engine in use and writes a label to the Node called `runtime` with it. The Node resource filter should be removed and users may need to grant the Kyverno ServiceAccount permission to update Nodes.
