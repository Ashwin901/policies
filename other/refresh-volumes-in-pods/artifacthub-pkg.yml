This policy watches for changes to ConfigMaps which have been marked for this quick reloading process which contain the label `kyverno.io/watch=true` and will write an annotation to any Pods which mount them as volumes causing a fast refresh in their contents. See the related policy entitled "Refresh Environment Variables in Pods" for a similar reloading process when ConfigMaps and Secrets are consumed as environment variables instead. Use of this policy may require providing the Kyverno ServiceAccount with permission to update Pods.

    # Refresh Volumes in Pods
    Although ConfigMaps and Secrets mounted as volumes to a Pod, when the contents change, will eventually propagate to the Pods mounting them, this process may take between 60-90 seconds.
