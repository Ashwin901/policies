description: ServiceAccounts which have the ability to edit/patch workloads which they created may potentially use that privilege to update to a different ServiceAccount with higher privileges. This policy, intended to be run in `enforce` mode, blocks updates to Pod controllers if those updates modify the serviceAccountName field. Updates to Pods directly for this field are not possible as it is immutable once set.
