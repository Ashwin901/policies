description: 'Secrets like registry credentials often need to exist in multiple Namespaces so Pods there have access. Manually duplicating those Secrets is time consuming and error prone. This policy will copy a Secret called `regcred` which exists in the `default` Namespace to new Namespaces when they are created. It will also push updates to the copied Secrets should the source Secret be changed.      '
