description: Sometimes a policy should be active or inactive based on a time window determined as part of the policy. Whether the policy should come into play should be dependent on that time. This policy illustrates how to time-bound any policy by using preconditions with JMESPath time filters. In this case, the policy enforces that label `foo` be required on all ConfigMaps during the hours of 8am-5pm EST (expressed in UTC). Additional, similar preconditions may be added to perform other time checks, for example a range of days.
