description: Supplemental groups control which group IDs containers add and can coincide with restricted groups on the host. Pod Security Policies (PSP) allowed a range of these group IDs to be specified which were allowed. This policy ensures any Pod may only specify supplementalGroup IDs between 100-200 or 500-600.
